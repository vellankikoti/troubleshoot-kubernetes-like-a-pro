## Network Connectivity Issues

### Description:
Pods are unable to communicate with each other or with external services due to network issues.

### Causes:
- Misconfigured network policies blocking traffic.
- DNS resolution failures between pods or external services.
- Issues with the CNI (Container Network Interface) plugin.

### Fix:
1. Verify the CNI plugin is correctly installed and running.
2. Check Kubernetes network policies to ensure traffic is allowed between pods.
3. Ensure DNS resolution is working within the cluster (e.g., check `/etc/resolv.conf` in the pod).
4. Test connectivity between pods using `kubectl exec` to run ping or curl commands.
