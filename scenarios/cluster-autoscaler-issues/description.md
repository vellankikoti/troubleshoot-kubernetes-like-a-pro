## Cluster Autoscaler Issues

### Description:
The Cluster Autoscaler fails to scale the nodes, resulting in insufficient resources to schedule pods.

### Causes:
- Misconfigured or missing Cluster Autoscaler settings.
- Resource requests and limits on pods being too large for the available nodes.
- Insufficient permissions for the Cluster Autoscaler to scale nodes.

### Fix:
1. Ensure that the Cluster Autoscaler is installed and properly configured.
2. Verify the autoscaler settings and ensure that the nodes have sufficient capacity for the pod resource requests.
3. Check the Cluster Autoscaler's logs for errors (`kubectl logs deployment/cluster-autoscaler`).
4. Ensure that IAM roles and permissions are correctly set up for autoscaling.
