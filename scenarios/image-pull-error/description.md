## Image Pull Error

### Description:
The pod fails to start because the image cannot be pulled from the registry, resulting in an `ErrImagePull` error.

### Causes:
- Incorrect image name or tag.
- Private registry without proper credentials.
- Network issues preventing access to the container registry.

### Fix:
1. Double-check the image name and tag for correctness.
2. Ensure that any private registry is accessible and that correct pull secrets are in place.
3. Test pulling the image manually using `docker pull` to verify connectivity and authentication.
4. Check for network issues or DNS resolution problems that may prevent the image from being pulled.
