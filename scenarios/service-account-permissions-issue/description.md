## Service Account Permissions Issue

### Description:
A pod fails to interact with Kubernetes APIs or other resources due to insufficient permissions for the associated service account.

### Causes:
- Missing or incorrect RBAC roles for the service account.
- The service account does not have necessary permissions to access specific resources (e.g., secrets, config maps).

### Fix:
1. Ensure that the service account has the required roles and role bindings.
2. Review and adjust RBAC configurations to ensure the pod has access to the necessary resources.
3. Apply `kubectl auth can-i` to check for permissions.
