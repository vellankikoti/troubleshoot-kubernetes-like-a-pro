## Pod Disruption Budget Violations

### Description:
Pods are being terminated or disrupted more than the allowed limits due to incorrect PodDisruptionBudget settings.

### Causes:
- PodDisruptionBudget (PDB) misconfigurations causing too many pods to be terminated at once.
- Violations due to insufficient replica counts or node disruptions.

### Fix:
1. Review and adjust the PodDisruptionBudget settings.
2. Ensure that the `minAvailable` or `maxUnavailable` settings reflect your desired tolerance for disruptions.
3. Check for sufficient pod replicas to handle disruptions.
