## CGroup Issues

### Description:
CGroup-related issues can occur when a pod is unable to limit or manage its resources like CPU or memory, leading to performance degradation or resource exhaustion.

### Causes:
- Misconfigured CGroup settings in the container runtime.
- Kernel version incompatibility with CGroup features.

### Fix:
1. Ensure that your Kubernetes nodes and container runtime support the necessary CGroup versions (v1 or v2).
2. Verify the CGroup settings in the container runtime (`docker info` or `containerd config`).
3. Adjust the pod resource settings and container runtime configurations to support CGroup resource limitations.
