## OOM Killed

### Description:
The pod is terminated due to the Out of Memory (OOM) killer process being invoked, often leading to pod restarts.

### Causes:
- The container exceeds the memory limit.
- Memory leaks in the application or excessive resource usage.

### Fix:
1. Review the memory usage of the application inside the container.
2. Increase the memory resource requests and limits in the pod spec.
3. Monitor the podâ€™s memory usage to identify spikes or memory leaks.
4. Optimize the application to reduce memory consumption if needed.
