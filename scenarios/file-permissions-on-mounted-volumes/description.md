## File Permissions on Mounted Volumes

### Description:
A pod fails to access or write to files on a mounted volume due to incorrect file permissions.

### Causes:
- The pod is running under a user with insufficient privileges.
- The volume has restrictive file permissions that prevent the pod from accessing the files.

### Fix:
1. Check the file permissions on the mounted volume (`kubectl exec <pod-name> -- ls -l <mount-path>`).
2. Adjust the permissions on the volume or set the correct security context in the pod specification.
3. Use the `fsGroup` field in the pod's security context to set the group ID for mounted volumes.
