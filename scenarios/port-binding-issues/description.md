## Port Binding Issues

### Description:
Pods fail to bind to the specified ports, causing service or application failure.

### Causes:
- Port conflicts between multiple pods or services.
- Incorrect configuration of the `containerPort` or `hostPort` settings.
- Insufficient permissions to bind the port on the node.

### Fix:
1. Ensure no other services or pods are binding to the same port.
2. Check the `containerPort` and `hostPort` settings in the pod spec for conflicts.
3. Verify that the Kubernetes node allows binding to the required ports.
4. Review the pod and service logs for more details on port binding failures.
