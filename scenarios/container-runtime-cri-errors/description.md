## Container Runtime CRI Errors

### Description:
Containers fail to start due to errors related to the container runtime interface (CRI), often leading to pod crash loops or failures in the Kubernetes node.

### Causes:
- Issues with the container runtime (e.g., Docker, containerd).
- Misconfiguration of CRI settings or corrupted runtime environment.
- Lack of sufficient disk space or resources for the runtime.

### Fix:
1. Check the container runtime logs for errors (`journalctl -u containerd` or `docker logs`).
2. Ensure the container runtime is correctly configured and running.
3. Verify the system has sufficient disk space (`df -h`).
4. Restart the container runtime service (`systemctl restart containerd` or `systemctl restart docker`).
