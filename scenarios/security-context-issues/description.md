## Security Context Issues

### Description:
Security context misconfigurations in the pod or container can lead to elevated privileges, security vulnerabilities, or resource access issues.

### Causes:
- Missing or incorrect securityContext fields in the pod or container spec.
- Improper user, group, or filesystem permissions.

### Fix:
1. Review and set the correct `securityContext` for the pod or container.
2. Ensure containers are running with the least privileges necessary.
3. If required, configure AppArmor or SELinux settings.
