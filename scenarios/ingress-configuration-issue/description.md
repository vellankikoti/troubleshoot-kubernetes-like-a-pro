## Ingress Configuration Issue

### Description:
Traffic routing issues occur due to misconfigured ingress, preventing external access to services.

### Causes:
- Incorrect ingress rules or paths.
- Missing or incorrect annotations for ingress controllers.
- Ingress controller not configured or unavailable.

### Fix:
1. Review and verify the ingress resource configuration.
2. Ensure that the ingress controller is properly installed and running.
3. Check that the service referenced in the ingress resource is correct and exists.
4. Validate any annotations required for specific ingress controllers (e.g., NGINX, Traefik).
