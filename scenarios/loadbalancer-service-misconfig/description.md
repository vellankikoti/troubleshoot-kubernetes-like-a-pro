## Load Balancer Service Misconfiguration

### Description:
A service exposed via a LoadBalancer does not work as expected, potentially due to misconfigured annotations or incorrect type settings.

### Causes:
- Incorrect `service.type` or annotations for the LoadBalancer.
- Misconfigured or missing health checks for backend services.

### Fix:
1. Ensure that the service type is set to `LoadBalancer`.
2. Verify that the correct annotations are applied for the cloud provider's load balancer (e.g., AWS, GCP).
3. Check the health check settings for the LoadBalancer to ensure proper traffic routing.
4. Review the LoadBalancer logs for any errors or misconfigurations.
