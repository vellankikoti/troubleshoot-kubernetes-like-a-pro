## Taints and Tolerations Mismatch

### Description:
Pods fail to be scheduled on nodes due to mismatches in taints and tolerations.

### Causes:
- A node is tainted but the pod doesn't have the appropriate tolerations.
- Incorrect `tolerations` configuration in the pod spec.

### Fix:
1. Ensure the node taints are correctly defined using `kubectl describe node`.
2. Add the corresponding tolerations in the pod spec.
3. Verify the podâ€™s toleration values match the taint values on the node.
4. Review the pod scheduling logs to identify any issues with taints or tolerations.
