## Image Pull Backoff

### Description:
Pods fail to start due to issues pulling the container image, leading to an `ImagePullBackOff` status.

### Causes:
- The container image does not exist or is incorrectly specified.
- Network issues preventing the image from being pulled.
- Insufficient permissions or incorrect credentials for pulling images from a private registry.

### Fix:
1. Verify that the image name and tag are correct.
2. Ensure the image exists in the container registry.
3. If using a private registry, make sure the necessary image pull secrets are in place.
4. Check the network connectivity and firewall settings preventing image pulling.
