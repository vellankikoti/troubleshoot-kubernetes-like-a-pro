## Service Port Mismatch

### Description:
The service is not accessible or fails to route traffic due to a port mismatch between the service and the pod.

### Causes:
- Incorrect port configuration in the service or pod specification.
- Mismatch between the `targetPort` in the service and the `containerPort` in the pod.

### Fix:
1. Ensure the `targetPort` in the service matches the `containerPort` in the pod specification.
2. Verify that the pod's container is listening on the specified port.
3. Check the service's port and ensure it is correctly exposed to the outside world.
