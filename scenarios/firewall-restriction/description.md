## Firewall Restriction

### Description:
Pods cannot communicate with external services or APIs due to firewall rules or network restrictions.

### Causes:
- Network policies or firewall rules blocking access to external services.
- Misconfigured or missing egress rules in network policies.

### Fix:
1. Check the firewall or network policy configurations to ensure that the correct ports are open for outbound communication.
2. If using Kubernetes Network Policies, verify that the egress rules allow external connections.
3. Review logs for network-related errors and adjust the firewall settings accordingly.
