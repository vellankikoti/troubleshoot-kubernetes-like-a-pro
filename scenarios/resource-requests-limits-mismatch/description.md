## Resource Requests and Limits Mismatch

### Description:
The pod fails to schedule due to a mismatch between resource requests and limits, often leading to inefficiencies in resource allocation.

### Causes:
- Requests are higher than limits, or limits are set too low compared to requests.
- Kubernetes scheduler unable to place the pod due to resource constraints.

### Fix:
1. Ensure that the resource `requests` are less than or equal to the `limits`.
2. Adjust the pod’s resource requests and limits based on the application’s actual resource usage.
3. Monitor resource usage over time to fine-tune the resource configurations.
