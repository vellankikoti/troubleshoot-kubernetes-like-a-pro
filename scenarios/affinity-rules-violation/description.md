## Affinity Rules Violation

### Description:
The pod fails to be scheduled due to misconfigured node affinity rules, where the available nodes do not match the pod's affinity specifications.

### Causes:
- Incorrect affinity rules defined in the pod spec.
- Nodes do not have the required labels for the affinity rules.

### Fix:
1. Check the affinity rules in the pod's YAML file.
2. Ensure that the required labels exist on the nodes (`kubectl get nodes --show-labels`).
3. Modify the pod's affinity rules to match the available nodes or add the required labels to the nodes.
