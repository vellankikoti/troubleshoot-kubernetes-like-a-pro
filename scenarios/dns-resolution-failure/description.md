## DNS Resolution Failure

### Description:
Pods cannot resolve DNS queries, often leading to failures in communication with external services or other pods.

### Causes:
- DNS service issues within the cluster.
- Incorrect DNS configurations in the pod.
- Network policies preventing DNS queries.

### Fix:
1. Check the DNS configuration in the cluster (`kubectl get svc kube-dns -n kube-system`).
2. Verify if the DNS resolver in the pod is set correctly.
3. Investigate network policies or firewalls that might block DNS traffic.
4. Test DNS resolution using `nslookup` or `dig` inside a pod.
