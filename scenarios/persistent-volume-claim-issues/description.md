## Persistent Volume Claim Issues

### Description:
The pod fails to mount the persistent volume due to issues with the PVC, such as no matching PV or incorrect access modes.

### Causes:
- PVC is not bound to a PV.
- Incorrect access modes or resource requirements in the PVC.

### Fix:
1. Ensure that the PVC is correctly bound to a PV.
2. Check the PVC and PV configurations to ensure matching access modes and resources.
3. If the PV is not available, create a new PV that satisfies the PVC requirements.
