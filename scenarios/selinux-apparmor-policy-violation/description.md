## SELinux/ AppArmor Policy Violation

### Description:
The pod fails to start due to violations of SELinux or AppArmor security policies that restrict access to system resources.

### Causes:
- Misconfigured SELinux or AppArmor profiles.
- Containers trying to access resources that are restricted by the security profiles.

### Fix:
1. Check the SELinux or AppArmor profiles for the container (`getenforce` for SELinux, or `aa-status` for AppArmor).
2. Modify the pod's security context to allow required actions or adjust the profiles.
3. Test the pod with the `securityContext` settings for SELinux or AppArmor.
