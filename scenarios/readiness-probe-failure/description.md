## Readiness Probe Failure

### Description:
The pod is marked as not ready because the readiness probe fails, preventing the pod from receiving traffic.

### Causes:
- Incorrectly configured readiness probe.
- The application inside the pod is not responding as expected.

### Fix:
1. Check the readiness probe configuration and adjust it to match the application's actual readiness behavior.
2. Verify the application inside the pod is running and able to handle requests on the specified path or port.
3. Test the pod's health by manually sending requests to the probe's endpoint.
4. Increase the `initialDelaySeconds` and `timeoutSeconds` if the application takes longer to start.
