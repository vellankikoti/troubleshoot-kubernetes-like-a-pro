## PID Namespace Collision

### Description:
PID namespace collision occurs when two containers within the same pod attempt to use the same process ID (PID), leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

### Causes:
- Misconfigured `hostPID` or `hostIPC` settings in the pod spec.
- Resource conflicts when running multiple containers that share namespaces.

### Fix:
1. Ensure that the `hostPID` and `hostIPC` settings are not misconfigured unless necessary.
2. If sharing namespaces is required, configure them properly to avoid collisions.
3. Review container logs and adjust container specifications to isolate processes.
