## Liveness Probe Failure

### Description:
The liveness probe fails, leading to the container being restarted because the container is considered unhealthy.

### Causes:
- Incorrect probe configuration (e.g., wrong endpoint or delay).
- Application is not starting properly and is unable to respond to the probe.

### Fix:
1. Check the liveness probe configuration in the pod YAML.
2. Verify if the application inside the container is working properly.
3. Adjust the probeâ€™s initial delay, timeout, and path as needed.
4. Use `kubectl logs <pod-name>` to check application logs for any issues.
